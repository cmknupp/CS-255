CS-255 - System Analysis and Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client, DriverPass, is striving to fill a community need by developing a program that helps prepare customers to take the driver’s test at the local MVD. DriverPass envisions a comprehensive system that combines online learning material, practice exams, classroom instruction, and on the road training.  

What did you do particularly well?
Assess the needs of the client from the interview and convert them into clear objectives and goals for the requirements document. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?  I wuuld remove detail from the background section so it speaks to the broader scope of the project instead of the details. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design?
I analyzed the interview transcript, going through it several times to ensure I didn't miss any of the requirements.  Once I had them gather I created a use case for each in the UML and then throught through the data flows to include all objects needed in the class diagram. 

Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Its important to consider the users needs so the solution you design meets all requirements and satisfies the customer. This also helps avoid scope creep.  

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I like working as a small team so that brainstorming is more productive.  Many approaches can lead to a working solution and having multiple people look at the problem makes it more likely to get the most efficient approach.
